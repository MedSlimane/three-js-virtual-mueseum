## üìã Overview

This project is a virtual museum that allows users to explore medical models in a 3D environment. The museum features various medical exhibits including:

- Operating Room
- DNA Lab Machine
- Human DNA Structure
- HIV Virus (Sectioned)
- Laparoscopic Trocar
- Medical Monitoring Equipment
- Medical Syringe
- Sci-Fi MRI Scanner
- Sphygmomanometer (Blood Pressure Monitor)

Users can navigate through the museum in first-person or orbit mode, manipulate the position and scale of the exhibited models, and view detailed information about each item.

## üöÄ Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (v19)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (v0.175.0)

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MedSlimane/three-js-virtual-mueseum.git
   cd muesuem
   ```

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. Start the development server

## üéÆ Controls

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `1`: Switch to translate mode (move objects)
  - `2`: Switch to scale mode (resize objects)
  - `R`: Reset object position and scale
  - `F`: Toggle between orbit and first-person control modes
  - `M`: Toggle menu visibility

- **Navigation**:
  - **Orbit Mode**: Click and drag to rotate the view, scroll to zoom
  - **First-Person Mode**: Use WASD keys to move, mouse to look around

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory. You can preview the production build with:

```bash
npm run preview
```
